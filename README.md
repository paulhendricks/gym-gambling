# gym-gambling

The [Gambling environment](https://github.com/paulhendricks/gym-gambling) is a single agent domain featuring discrete and continuous state and action spaces. Currently, one task is supported:

## Staking

This environment corresponds to the version of the gambling problem described in Example 1.2 in [Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning by Csaba Szepesvari (2010)](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/RLBook.html).

## Future tasks

Future tasks will have more complex environments that an agent can plan such as:

 * Blackjack
 * Poker
 * Roulette
 * Slots
 * Eucher

# Installation
